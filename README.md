This project uses a test driven development (except from the GUI). All tests involved are collected in the *test* directory.
The *space* directory contains the class entity and all the actual entities that will appear on the GUI.
In the *gui* directory there are all files responsible for showing the game window and it's component and for managing interactions between entities.
